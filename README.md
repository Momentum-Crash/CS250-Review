# **CS250-Review**
Sprint Review and Retrospective for class CS-250


**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program and how does creating “user stories” help with this?**

I interpret user needs by creating a story for the need on a usage basis. I understand how the feature will be used and what needs to be functioning to accomplish the requirement set. The user story helps both parties understand each other without complicated documentation in the way. The client/customer/end-user has to be understood by the development team and that user story is the best way for both to communicate the need to the team.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

I approach developing programs by understanding what is needed to be created a general framework should be created first to understand how goals will be met. I hope to incorporate the sprint into my future development work by creating modular pieces of code instead of the entire program at once.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Honest collaboration between all members of the team even ones you may not understand. I think transparency goes along with this in that everyone should understand their role to fill and where others will fill in and create parts of the product being developed.
